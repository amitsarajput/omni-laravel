    "As the EU heads towards its goal of becoming CO2 neutral by 2050 it is trying to cut emissions across various sectors including the transport sector. The new EU tyre labelling regulation aims to help achieve this goal by reducing CO2 levels as it provides the consumers information to identify and purchase more fuel efficient tyres.": "",
    "The new EU labelling Regulation (EU) 2020/740 comes into effect from 1st May 2021 and replaces the previous Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009, which has been in effect from 2012. This labelling scheme allows consumers to make an informed purchase decision on the various performance paraments of the tyres such as rolling resistance which translates into fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise. Additionally, the new labelling also introduces pictograms that indicate if the tyre is suitable for use in severe snow conditions(3PMSF) and its grip in icy conditions (the later applies to C1 tyres only).": "",

    "DEVELOPING THE FUTURE OF PERFORMANCE: RADAR TYRES AND THE SCIENCE OF INNOVATION": "",
    "Meet Olli Seppälä, the head of global R&D at Radar Tyres and a trailblazer in the tyre industry. With over 20 years of experience in tyre development, Olli’s expertise spans from heavy-duty products to passenger car tyres, with a focus on delivering exceptional performance and keeping tyres affordable for all.": "",
    "A CAREER BUILT ON EXPERTISE": "",
    "Olli’s journey in tyre innovation began at Nokian Tyres, where he spent nearly two decades honing his skills in product development and leading R&D teams. In 2022, he joined Radar Tyres, bringing a wealth of experience and a passion for pushing boundaries. “The tyre industry has evolved tremendously in the past 20 years,” Olli explains. “Performance demands, sustainability requirements, and legislative standards have all become more stringent, making innovation more critical than ever.”": "",
    "THE COMPLEXITY OF MODERN TYRES": "",
    "A modern tyre is far more than just a rubber ring. “Each tyre comprises about 20 components,” Olli notes. “Every element impacts the others, requiring meticulous balancing to achieve optimal performance.” One key area is tread compounds, where advancements in silica technology have significantly enhanced wet grip and rolling resistance, albeit with new challenges to overcome.": "",
    "THE MAGIC TRIANGLE OF TYRE DEVELOPMENT": "",
    "Tyre development is a fine art, requiring a careful balance of wet grip, rolling resistance, and mileage — often referred to as the “Magic Triangle.” As Olli explains, “Improving one aspect often comes at the expense of the others. Our mission is to expand this triangle, achieving outstanding performance across all metrics.” Through their expertise, Olli and his team have excelled in delivering exceptional results in every area.": "",
    "A UNIQUE BUSINESS MODEL": "",
    "Radar Tyres operates without its own manufacturing facilities, a strategic choice that Olli sees as a game-changer. “We can select the best production locations for each product, ensuring top performance and cost-effectiveness,” he explains. “This agility allows us to innovate faster and more efficiently than traditional tyre makers.”": "",
    "INNOVATION BEYOND THE TYRE: A GLOBAL APPROACH": "",
    "For Olli, innovation isn’t limited to tread patterns or compounds. “It’s about rethinking the entire process, from business models to supply chains,” he explains. This philosophy extends to Radar Tyres’ rigorous global testing process. “We conduct tests worldwide, from winter conditions in Finland to dry tracks in Spain and field testing in the U.S. and Asia,” Olli shares. “This ensures our tyres meet the specific needs of diverse markets while maintaining top-tier performance.”": "",
    "DEMOCRATIZING PREMIUM PERFORMANCE": "",
    "Olli’s mission is clear: to make premium-level tyre performance accessible to all. “Safety is our top priority, and it’s vital that consumers can rely on their tyres in critical moments,” he says. “Our goal is to deliver tyres that compete with premium brands while remaining affordable, ensuring safety and performance for every driver.”": "",
    "LOOKING TO THE FUTURE": "",
    "As the automotive industry shifts towards electrification, Radar Tyres is already adapting. “Electric vehicles bring unique challenges, such as reduced noise and higher torque requirements,” Olli says. “We’re designing tyres that not only meet these demands but also enhance the overall driving experience.”": "",
    "A VISION OF EXCELLENCE": "",
    "“We’re here to redefine what’s possible in the tyre industry,” Olli concludes. “By combining top-tier performance with affordability, we’re democratizing premium tyres and ensuring that safety and quality are within everyone’s reach.”": "",

    "When it comes to tyres, few individuals can match the expertise and passion of Stéphane Clepkens, Test Manager at Radar Tyres. With a career spanning nearly 25 years in the automotive industry, Stéphane brings a unique perspective to the intricate art of tyre testing and development.": "",
    "A career forged on the track": "",
    "Stéphane began his journey in 2000 as a test driver for Continental Tyres, focusing on Original Equipment (OE) tyres for BMW. Over the next three years, he honed his skills in precision testing, learning the nuances of chassis and tyre dynamics. In 2003, Stéphane took a bold leap into freelancing, collaborating with leading tyre brands such as Dunlop, Yokohama, Hankook, and Bridgestone.": "",
    "A key highlight of Stéphane’s career has been his expertise on the legendary Nürburgring Nordschleife in Germany. For over a decade, he spent up to 15 weeks annually mastering the world’s most demanding racetrack, where he not only tested tyres but also trained future test drivers.": "",
    "Joining Radar Tyres: a new chapter": "",
    "Stéphane’s decision to join Radar Tyres was driven by the company’s progressive approach. “Radar Tyres impressed me with their flat, horizontal management structure and the freedom they offer to innovate,” Stéphane shares. “Their mission to deliver premium-level performance at accessible prices aligns perfectly with my vision of democratising tyre safety and quality.”": "",
    "A unique philosophy on tyre testing": "",
    "For Stéphane, real-world testing is at the heart of tyre development. “Tyres are complex and highly technical products,” he explains. “Their performance can only be truly understood under real driving conditions, where we transform subjective customer feedback into objective targets for research and development.”": "",
    "Redefining premium": "",
    "Stéphane’s mission at Radar Tyres is clear: to elevate the brand to premium status while ensuring that its products remain affordable for all. “Every market is different, and in Europe, I know what customers and carmakers expect from their tyres,” he says. “Reaching premium standards requires targeting the same benchmarks as the established leaders, but we’re committed to achieving this without compromising on cost-effectiveness.”": "",
    "Making safety accessible": "",
    "Stéphane’s passion extends beyond performance metrics to the broader impact of his work. “Tyres are the only points of contact between a car and the road,” he notes. “Democratising premium tyre performance means providing young drivers, retirees, and everyone in between with access to safe, reliable products.”": "",
    "Looking ahead": "",

        "Shaping the future of tyre design: Fabrizio Giugiaro and Radar Tyres": "",
    "Meet Fabrizio Giugiaro, the visionary designer behind some of the world’s most iconic automotive creations and the founder of GFG Style. Now, he brings his expertise to Radar Tyres, redefining what tyre design means in terms of aesthetics, performance, and accessibility.": "",
    "Design meets performance": "",
    "For over two years, GFG Style has collaborated with Radar Tyres to create innovative tyre designs across all categories—from high-performance sports tyres to rugged off-road models and eco-friendly solutions. “Great design is not just about appearance; it must bring value and technology together,” Giugiaro explains. “The best results come from blending creativity with technical precision.”": "",
    "At Radar Tyres, this philosophy is embedded in every product. The design process is not just about style—it is about ensuring the tyre enhances both function and performance without driving up costs.": "",
    "Inspired by function, driven by innovation": "",
    "When creating a new tyre design, inspiration comes from various sources, but at the core, performance dictates form. “First, we look at the technical requirements—what the tyre needs to achieve,” Giugiaro says. “Then, we integrate shapes and structures that enhance both aesthetics and function. Nature sometimes plays a role, but ultimately, it is about a perfect balance between engineering and creativity.”": "",
    "This meticulous attention to detail ensures that Radar Tyres are not only visually striking but also aerodynamically optimized, offering both efficiency and grip in demanding conditions.": "",
    "Luxury without the price tag": "",
    "Radar Tyres has a bold mission: to make premium tyre design accessible to all. Giugiaro believes that high-end aesthetics should not be reserved for the few but should be part of everyday driving experiences. “By refining the shapes and surface details, we create tyres that express luxury and performance without unnecessary cost,” he explains. “True innovation is about making great design available to everyone.”": "",
    "A universal language of design": "",
    "With decades of global automotive design experience, Giugiaro understands how to craft a style that resonates across different markets. “A tyre must be recognizable, distinctive, and appealing to all kinds of drivers,” he says. “The goal is to create a design language that is both unique and universally understood.”": "",
    "The result? Radar Tyres stand out with a strong visual identity—defined by sharp details, elegant proportions, and an unmistakable presence on the road.": "",
    "The art and science of tyre identity": "",
    "One of Giugiaro’s proudest achievements is the introduction of a consistent styling language across all Radar Tyres. “We wanted to ensure that every Radar tyre carries a recognizable design DNA,” he explains. “It’s about more than just a tread pattern—it’s about shaping an identity that communicates performance and sophistication.”": "",
    "Among his favorite creations is the Renegade X -series, inspired by aeronautical design. “That was a breakthrough,” he notes. “It set the foundation for how we approach the rest of the Radar lineup, combining aerodynamics with bold aesthetics.”": "",
    "The future of tyre design": "",
    "As automotive design evolves, so must tyres. “Vehicles are becoming more advanced, and tyres need to keep up,” Giugiaro says. “Design is not just about beauty; it’s about integrating the tyre seamlessly into the vehicle’s overall identity.”": "",
    "Looking ahead, he sees tyre design playing an even bigger role in defining a car’s character. “Tyres will not just be functional components; they will be key visual and performance elements that enhance the entire driving experience.”": "",
    "Democratising premium design": "",
    "Radar Tyres and GFG Style share a common mission: to make premium design accessible. “The challenge is to create something that is not just artistic, but also durable, smart, and universally desirable,” Giugiaro says. “We’ve developed a language that is sophisticated yet inclusive—something that every driver can appreciate.”": "",
    "A legacy in the making": "",
    "The partnership between Radar Tyres and GFG Style is just beginning. “This collaboration is about more than just designing tyres,” Giugiaro concludes. “It’s about shaping the future—where performance, beauty, and accessibility go hand in hand.”": "",
    "With Fabrizio Giugiaro leading the design vision, Radar Tyres is setting a new standard in the industry, proving that great design isn’t just for the elite—it’s for everyone.": "",
